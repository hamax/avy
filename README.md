 - Clone this repository
 - Move to the avy (root) directory an run "goapp serve" (https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/devserver)
 - Add "avy", "www.avy" and "anif.avy" to your hosts file (/etc/hosts on Linux)
 - Open your browser and navigate to http://avy:8080
 - (you can find AppEngine admin console at http://avy:8000)

## Pushing changes to production

To push changes to algoviz.net you need my permission fist, but you can also create your own AppEngine project and push there.

To get started with AppEngine go here: https://cloud.google.com/products/app-engine/

Once you have an AppEngine project, you can push the code using "goapp deploy" or "appcfg.py --oauth2 update ." if you prefer using OAuth/password-less authentication (I certainly do). Before you do the push, you need to change the configuration in the "server/server.go" file (domain name and port number).
